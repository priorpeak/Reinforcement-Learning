- Ran the original util (generating 10000 images) and planner (with only 2 layers with ReLUs) python files to gain baseline losses for later reference
- Edited utils.py to generate 30000 images of drive data and recorded registered losses after running the baseline planner
	- Generating 30000 drive data images dropped loss in epoch 149 from 0.115 to 0.107, a 0.008 improvement
- Increased number of epochs run in planner and recorded losses
