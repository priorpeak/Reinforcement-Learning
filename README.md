# RetentionKart
## An attempt at improving lap times in PySuperTuxKart with Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and other cool buzzwords for Boston University's ENG EC400 -- Retention Learning

### Optimization 1
#### Generating more drive data

Currently set to generate 10k images from the tracks, Shirts and Skins will *insert filler* 
We believe that increasing the dataset will improve loss, and by extension overall performance.

Outcomes:

Shirts:

Skins:

### Optimization 2
#### Tweaking training times to yield better results

Currently set to 150 epochs, Shirts and Skins will edit and "tweak" training times in an attempt to observe improved "loss" using the trainer. We oberved from previous assignments that as epoch time increased, Loss stopped decreasing consistently. 
We believe that slightly adding more "epochs" will improve loss by a measurable (but not widly significant) amount.

Outcomes:

Shirts:

Skins:


### Optimization 3
#### Adding more functionality to Controller

Based on the documentation sent to us by Professor Olshevsky, editing the controller to allow for "better" interaction with the game (i.e. using powerups and nitro and the "rescue" function). 
This would be purely including the additional functions/"game commands" included in the manual to improve lap times.

Outcomes:

Shirts: 

Skins: 

### Optimization 4  
#### Using more NN functions 

*change this* description

-use more of the pytorch functions (maxpool, functionalMax, etc) to improve performance.
-Tweak layers?
	- find a sweet spot for number of layers and "algorithm" for optimal inputs/outputs between each layer.
